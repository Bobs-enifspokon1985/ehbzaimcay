OMG, dude, just finished watching iHostage. What a trip! ü§Ø. So this movie... like, don't even know where to start. It totally had me on edge one minute and cracking up the next. Classic mix of WTF and genius moments. You know the kind of film that just hooks you and then you're like, Did I just lose two hours of my life?, but somehow you‚Äôre okay with it? Yeah, that‚Äôs it.

Like, right, so there's this dude‚Äîthe main character‚Äîwho's just so full of himself. But then again, who wouldn't be when you're basically running from death every two minutes? There are moments it feels like a rollercoaster designed on chaos settings. I wish I could just download the movie into my brain and relive those 'OMG' scenes anytime. üòÇ

> Anyway, the bad guys were kind of generic, except that one dude with the insane accent. Why do the villains always have the best voices? Is that, like, a rule now? Should I ask someone in the movie biz? Speaking of which, did I mention the soundtrack? Because man, the music was just killer. One minute it's all tense violin, the next, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre jamming at a rave. Can a movie have a split personality? Seriously.

Some plot holes you could drive a truck through, though... like, how did they even come up with this script? Just throw 5 random Netflix thrillers in a blender and hope for a cult classic, yeah? But I gotta give it to them, it's worth watching if you want something to make your brain itch in all the right ways. Plus, gotta love a movie that serves up twists like free refills.

if (i == 10) { break; }

Okay shutting up now. I‚Äôm not gonna pretend I understood everything but hey, money well spent? Would I watch the movie again? Probably not alone because I think I need someone else to freak out with next time. Lemme know if you check it out. Catch you later! ‚úåÔ∏è
